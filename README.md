# Fake News Detection Model

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can classify news articles as either **fake** or **real**. The model leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the content of the articles and determine their authenticity. The primary goal is to contribute to efforts in combating misinformation and improving the accuracy of online information.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: The input text is cleaned and processed, including tokenization, removing stop words, and vectorization using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The project uses machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning models like LSTM or BERT.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated to measure the model's performance.
- **Dataset**: A dataset containing labeled news articles (real or fake) is used to train and test the model.
